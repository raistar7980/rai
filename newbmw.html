        ......Corporations need business communication when dealing with their main stakeholders (e.g., consumers, inner members, investors, societies, government). To consumers, corporations need to sell their products and gain a higher level of trust and loyalty from consumers (Choi, 2013;Jaganathan, Mayr, & Nagaratnam, 2014;Kang, 2014;Kim & Benbasat, 2006;Kisicek, 2018). For example, they need to persuade inner members of the necessity of structural reform of the organization such as downsizing and relieve the dissatisfaction of members for smoother structural reform (Hossfeld, 2018). ...
        ... Corporations can support pro-corporation governmental officials, social groups, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/BMW-advertisement-in-the-English-daily_fig2_267569312">view</a> opinion leaders to influence laws and policies for them. Choi (2013), Jaganathan et al. (2014), Kang (2014), Benbasat (2006, 2009) and Kisicek (2018) focus on consumers. They use printed and textual advertisements because it is easy to find logical relationships among the parts of advertisements. ...
        ... When advertising their products, advertisers need to consider the differences among the diverse backgrounds of customers. Jaganathan et al. (2014) investigate the differences of emphasis to English and German customers even though corporations run the same automobile advertisements. The focus of Kim and Benbasat (2006) differs from that of others. ...

        <u>➡How BMW Builds Brand Equity Through Local Marketing [Updated 2023-2024]</u>
        The positive perception of a brand is priceless. Thanks to investments made in improving the customer experience, multi-location organizations — like 7-Eleven, McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts, The UPS Store — have positioned themselves as industry leaders.

        However, building and maintaining that clout can be quite the challenge. By running effective brand awareness campaigns, deploying a multi-channel marketing strategy and delivering superior customer service, companies can start to build up their brand equity <br>

    <u>➔History:-</u>
    The history of the BMW Group reaches back to 1916. Today, the four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce, and BMW Motorrad make the BMW Group one of the world’s leading premium suppliers of automobiles, motorcycles, as well as mobility services. Since the beginning of its history, the company has kept its sight firmly set on the future and has consequently put sustainability and efficient resource management into the centre of its strategy.

   <u>   ➔Emissions standards:-

   </u>
   <br/>
   <br/>

   Tailpipe emissions standards for motorcycles continue to be strengthened. In 1980 the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first regulated new motorcycle hydrocarbon emissions, requiring motorcycles to emit less than 5.0 grams per km (0.3 ounce per mile) of highway driving. California and the European Union (EU) imposed stricter limits on hydrocarbons and added restrictions on nitric oxides and carbon monoxide. In 2006 emissions from new motorcycles sold in the United States were limited to a combined 1.4 grams of hydrocarbons and nitric oxides and 12.0 grams of carbon monoxide per km. The EPA decreased the limit on combined emissions of hydrocarbons and nitric oxides to 0.8 gram in 2010. The EU reduced emissions from new motorcycles in 2004 to 1.0 gram of hydrocarbons, 0.3 gram of nitric oxides, and 5.5 grams of carbon monoxide per km; in 2007 these levels were further reduced to 0.3 gram of hydrocarbons, 0.15 gram of nitric oxides, and 2.0 grams of carbon monoxide per km. The EU did a further emission reduction in 2016 to 0.17 gram of hydrocarbons, 0.09 gram of nitric oxides, and 1.14 grams of carbon monoxide, with a further reduction to 0.1 gram of hydrocarbons, 0.06 gram of nitric oxides, and 1 gram of carbon monoxide planned for 2020. Although U.S. limits for carbon monoxide were not lowered by law, the required reductions in other pollutants effectively lowered carbon monoxide emissions in fact. In order to meet these “clean-air regulations,” manufacturers installed more sophisticated catalytic converters and fuel-injection systems.
